# Point Poker

Point poker but in rust with wasm ðŸ¤¯

### Requirements

- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- wasm32  target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- trunk & wasm-bindgen-cli: `cargo install trunk wasm-bindgen-cli`
- sass/dart-sass: `npm install -g sass`

### Running

```bash
trunk serve
```

Rebuilds the app whenever a change is detected and runs a local server to host it.

There's also the `trunk watch` command which does the same thing but without hosting it.

### Release

```bash
trunk build --release
```

This builds the app in release mode similar to `cargo build --release`.
You can also pass the `--release` flag to `trunk serve` if you need to get every last drop of performance.

Unless overwritten, the output will be located in the `dist` directory.
